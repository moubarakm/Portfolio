In this data visualisation project, the U.S. currency is compared against some of the top currencies in the world.
Although the CSV file contains the exchange rate of every country, users can select which countries they would like to display
in their graphs by changing the code accordingly. This interactive plot can simultaneously compare exchange rates and also filter for 
specific time periods using the slider.
