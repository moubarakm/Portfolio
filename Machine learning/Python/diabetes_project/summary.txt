The aim of this project was to visualise some of the key associations amongst the dataset attributes and test out 
the relative predictive capabilities of some of the most commonly used classification algorithms. These include KNN, Decision tree,
Support vector machine, Random forests and Logistic regression. Some data preprocessing was required before analysis could be conducted.
